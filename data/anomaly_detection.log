2024-09-26 10:05:07,675 - ERROR - Error during model training: Feature names are only supported if all input features have string names, but your input has ['int', 'str'] as feature name / column name types. If you want feature names to be stored and validated, you must convert them all to strings, by using X.columns = X.columns.astype(str) for example. Otherwise you can remove feature / column names from your input data, or convert them all to a non-string data type.
